# FileTools

Use FileTools to easy modify files in ways that you cannot normally do.  This includes setting the creation and modification date, removing quicktime timestamps, and securely deleting a file (or folder).

## Wonderful GUI

FileTools has a great Graphical User Interface, including a side menu that resembles that of Mail.app, and a fancy Cocoa switch.  These features are located in their own class, so that it's easy to take them and use them in other projects.  
Here is an example of a fancy side bar:
