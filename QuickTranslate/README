Quickly translate a piece of text from english to french, and the other way around.  I created a small JSON parser in order to use Google Translator's API, but it cannot parse all JSON data.  It was built for parsing arrays containing strings, more arrays, and numbers.  

My GTTranslator class is a straight forward way to translate any text between languages.  Use it like this for english to french:

GTTranslator * translate = [[GTTranslator alloc] initWithLanguage:kGTLanguageEnglish];
NSString * french = [translate AsynchronouslyTranslate:@"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog." toLangauge:kGTLanguageFrench];
NSLog(@"French: %@", french);
[translate release];

The class also comes with a synchronous method of translating, which is what this application uses.  Both work through Google's server, so if google changes their API, the whole thing will break!
