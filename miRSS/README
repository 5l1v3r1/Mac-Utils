This is a small mac os x application that runs in the menu bar, allowing the user to follow RSS feeds.  It provides a great UI for browsing your RSS feed, as well as click and type feed subscription.

miRSS is in the process of becoming scriptable.  This means that you will be able to do the following through applescript:
- get the number of RSS channels that you are subscribed to
- get the name, url, and index of any RSS channel
- add an RSS channel by means of URL
- open an RSS feed in a viewer window
- unsubscribe to an RSS feed

You will soon be able to read the individual posts in an RSS channel and open them in a new window from scripts, but those have not yet been implimented.  Just to give an example, here is a script that will allow you to communicate with miRSS while it is running:

tell application "miRSS"
	
	set props to properties
	set countn to feedcount of props
	display dialog "There are " & (countn) & " channels." buttons {"OK"} default button 1
	-- get the first RSS feed
	
	set i1 to item 1 of every rssfeed
	get title of i1
	set titlen to result
	display dialog "Title of the first object is " & titlen & "." buttons {"OK"} default button 1
	
	set mfeed to make new rssfeed with properties {title:"Test", rssurl:"http://www.demo.com/community/?q=taxonomy/term/1451/feed"}
	
	-- wait for it to add the feed to the list
	
	set props to properties
	set countn to feedcount of props
	display dialog "There are " & (countn) & " channels." buttons {"OK"} default button 1
	
	-- unsubscribe looks at the rssurl of an item
	-- so technically you can unsubscribe to any
	-- rss URL....
	set lastfeeditem to item countn of every rssfeed
	unsubscribe to feed lastfeeditem
	
	-- read from it
	set firstfeeditem to item 1 of every rssfeed
	feedopen feed firstfeeditem
	
end tell
